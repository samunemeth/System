# Goal

I am trying to achieve a minimal NixOS installation for productivity.
I use Qtile as my window manager, Neovim for text and code editing,
Firefox for browsing and Lf for file management.
For settings, I try to use Rofi menus where possible.
I am mainly using these systems for internet browsing and LaTeX compilation.

# Setup

> [!NOTE]
> For further guidance, look at the [official installation documentation](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#sec-installation),
> the [NixOS wiki on btrfs with encryption](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Btrfs#Installation_with_encryption),
> and [this helpful video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUB2rwDUm5A).

> [!WARNING]
> There are missing steps in this guide at the moment, marked with "MISSINGSTEP".


  - Get an install media to boot, then switch to the root user with:
    ```
    sudo -i
    ```
  - *If* you don't have a wired connection, connect to a WiFi network with the
    following commands:
    ```
    sudo systemctl start wpa_supplicant
    wpa_cli

    add_network
    set_network 0 ssid "<YOUR-SSID>"
    set_network 0 psk "<YOUR-PASSWORD>"
    enable_network 0

    quit
    ```
  - Do a network sanity check with `ping`:
    ```
    ping google.com
    ```
  - If you want some program to help you with the installation, you can install
    it now. `git` is needed, and I suggest using `lf` for easier file management,
    but the latter is not necessary:
    ```
    nix-shell -p git lf <YOUR-PACKAGES>
    ```
  - **Create your partitions.**
    - I usually use `cfdisk`. MISSINGSTEPS
  - **Format your partitions.**
    - Just follow the instruction on the [NixOS wiki on btrfs with encryption](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Btrfs#Installation_with_encryption)
      while omitting the parts for `/mnt/var/log` and `/mnt/persist`. MISSINGSTEPS
  - **Mount your partitions.**
    - Follow the same guide as above. MISSINGSTEPS
  - Get some host ssh keys for your machine. This can be done in two different
    ways:
    - Generate some **new** host ssh keys for your new machine:
      ```
      ssh-keygen -A -f /mnt
      ```
      In this case, the new keys need to be added to the `.sops.yaml` file,
      and the keys need to be updated. MISSINGSTEPS
    - Copy some existing keys from an external drive. MISSINGSTEPS
  - Clone this repository into the installers home directory, and change into it:
    ```
    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/samunemeth/System.git
    cd System
    ```
    The following commands are all run from the working directory.
  - Create a new host is most easily done by coping an existing host's
    directory and adapting it:
    ```
    cp -r ~/System/hosts/<SOURCE-HOST> ~/System/hosts/<YOUR-HOST>
    ```
    MISSINGSTEPS
  - Generate the hardware configuration for the system directly to the new host's
    directory:
    ```
    nixos-generate-config --root /mnt --dir ~/System/hosts/<YOUR-HOST>/
    ```
    MISSINGSTEPS
  - You will have to add these changes in git:
    ```
    git add .
    ```
  - After all the changes are made and committed, you can finally install the
    system from the flake:
    ```
    nixos-install --flake .#<YOUR-HOST>
    ```
  - As the changes are still not pushed to GitHub, you will need to move the
    current git repository to the new users home:
    ```
    cp -r ~/System /mnt/home/<YOUR-USER>/
    ```
  - Everything should be ready to use, you can boot into the installation.
    ```
    reboot
    ```
  - *If* the login screen does not work, you can switch to a virtual terminal by
    pressing `ctrl+shift+f2`, logging in and disabling the mini greeter with the
    following in your host's `configuration.nix`:
    ```nix
    services.xserver.displayManager.lightdm.greeters.mini.enable = lib.mkForce false;
    ```
  - Get the ownership of the repository, as it was copied by a root user
    during installation.
    ```
    sudo chown -R <YOUR-USER>:users ~/System
    ```
    TODO: Move to live medium phase?
  - Change the remote URL of the repository to use ssh:
    ```
    cd ~/System
    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:samunemeth/System.git
    ```
  - Everything should be set! Rebuild with `nrs` and reboot to see if everything
    works as expected.


## Sops

Get an *age* public key of your machines host ssh key:
```bash
nix-shell -p ssh-to-age --run 'cat /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub | ssh-to-age'
```
MISSINGSTEPS


## WiFi

Some WiFi networks are declared in the Nix configuration and `secrets.yaml` file.
To add a network, create and identifier for it, in this example, let that be `*WORK*.

**If *WORK* is a regular network:**

Then add it to the `normal_networks` list in the `networks.yaml` file, than append
the following to the `wireless-env` key in the `secrets.yaml` file:
```
    WORK_SSID=<SSID>
    WORK_MGMT=<MGMT-METHOD>
    WORK_PASS=<PASSWORD>
```
Replace `<SSID>`, `<MGMT-METHOD>` and `<PASSWORD>` accordingly.
Where `<MGMT-METHOD>` is usually either `wpa-psk` or `sae`. You can find out the 
exact value by saving the network imperatively and looking at the generated configuration.

**If *WORK* is an enterprise network:**


Then add it to the `normal_networks` list in the `networks.yaml` file, than append
the following to the `wireless-env` key in the `secrets.yaml` file:
```
    WORK_SSID=<SSID>
    WORK_IDEN=<USERNAME>
    WORK_PASS=<PASSWORD>
```
Replace `<SSID>`, `<USERNAME>` and `<PASSWORD>` accordingly.

Setting up a WPA enterprise network imperatively does not work with `nmtui`
or `networkmanager_dmenu` for some reason.
Here are some command for setting up such a network:
```bash
nmcli connection add type wifi con-name "<SSID>" ssid "<SSID>"
nmcli connection modify "<SSID>" wifi-sec.key-mgmt wpa-eap 802-1x.eap peap 802-1x.phase2-auth mschapv2 802-1x.identity "<IDENTITY>" 802-1x.password "<PASSWORD>"
nmcli connection up "<SSID>"
```
Replace `<SSID>`, `<IDENTITY>` and `<PASSWORD>` accordingly.

To list all the connections saved, and their configuration file location, use
the following command:
```bash
sudo nmcli -f NAME,DEVICE,FILENAME connection show
```

## Fix for Missing Bootloader

Say that you accidentally deleted your boot partition, or the boot entries for
NixOS in your boot partition.

  - Boot a live medium that you would use for installing a new system.
  - Make sure you are running as root:
    ```bash
    sudo -i
    ```
  - Do the steps from the [setup](#Setup) guide for mounting all the partitions in the
    correct places.
  - Enter the mounted system:
    ```bash
    nixos-enter
    ```
  - Run the command for installing a bootloader for a new system:
    ```bash
    NIXOS_INSTALL_BOOTLOADER=1 /nix/var/nix/profiles/system/bin/switch-to-configuration boot --flake /home/<USER>/System#<HOST>
    ```
    The path to the flake is relative to the root of the machine entered, so the
    `/mnt` prefix needs to be omitted. Replace the path with the path to your
    flake.
  - Exit and reboot:
    ```bash
    exit
    reboot
    ```

*Based on the [NixOS wiki's bootloader page](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Bootloader#From_an_installation_media).*


## Other Fixes

Sometimes stuff gets stuck in `/tmp`, and prevents packages from being garbage
collected. Just clear the `/tmp` directory and reboot:
```bash
sudo rm -rf /tmp/*
sudo reboot
```


# Imperative Parts

There are some things that are still missing form the declarative configuration:

  - Seafile configuration.
  - Some parts of Firefox.
  - Basically VSCode as a whole.
  - Gnome.
  - Account Logins (Firefox, Google, VSCode, GitHub)

*Everything else should be configured declaratively!*


# Resources

Here I have collected some useful resources I have used to create
this configuration.
For general linux questions, it is usually a good idea to consult the
[Arch Wiki](https://docs.qtile.org/en/stable/index.html).
